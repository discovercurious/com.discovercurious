I\'ve spent countless hours trying to reconcile the time it takes to produce excellent design and marketing content with the weekly progress of efficiently gaining qualified sales leads that actually contribute to business results, specifically revenue. I’ve seen frameworks like Google’s OKRs help creative teams go from being unsure of their priorities to driving business outcomes. While OKRs work great for venture-backed or hyper-growth companies chasing a massive total addressable market, it can be challenging to implement for small to medium-size businesses. The book Traction by Gino Wickman outlines a great alternative to help focus the finite resources of smaller companies. Traction details "The Entrepreneurial Operating System®," which was created by Wickman, and is a method that will help you realize your organization’s vision. ',spans:[{start:449,end:462,type:t,data:{link_type:i,url:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR"}},{start:639,end:663,type:t,data:{link_type:i,url:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market"}},{start:746,end:770,type:t,data:{link_type:i,url:l}},{start:857,end:865,type:"em"},{start:875,end:912,type:t,data:{link_type:i,url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XU7TkzEe8&t=77s"}}]},{type:e,text:"Applying a system like EOS gives marketing teams the tools they need to uncover and focus on their highest impact activities, including where to most efficiently allocate their marketing dollars.
