This helped Grammarly understand its customers and target them with a strategy that they would engage with.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Another contributor to Grammarly’s success was its iterative strategy. Instead of going after new markets, they went after the low-hanging fruit. When growth started to flatten, Grammarly didn’t try to build a new product.

This makes testing potential solutions invaluable. If you don’t first identify low-performing options, you could get stuck with a strategy that’s a drain on resources instead of a boost to business performance.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Choosing how you identify low-performing strategies is just as important of a decision. Traditionally, clients hire a business consultant to test and research every possibility, this consultant then creates a robust strategy. This approach is expensive and time-consuming. It can take several months and cost tens of thousands of dollars with additional costs for execution. This cost is more than the average small to medium sized business can handle.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"An iterative strategy flips this approach. Instead of creating a comprehensive plan from day one, an iterative strategy starts by identifying the low-hanging fruit. For example, your current marketing focus could be very narrow like Grammarly’s. Could widening it to encompass one or two more industries double your reach without changing your product? An iterative strategy focuses on wins like these and uses the momentum you achieve to build up to a bigger strategy.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Another difference between iterative and traditional approaches is the opportunity for testing and change. With the traditional approach, the business strategy will only go through minimal adjustments once it’s set. The momentum from a failing strategy is nearly impossible to stop, which can lead to significant financial waste. On the other hand, iterative approaches give your business the opportunity to test multiple strategies and build on results instead of theories.","spans":[]},{"type":"heading4","text":"Your strategy starts with asking the right questions","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Imagine that a company produces vital signs monitors for healthcare organizations and they read an article on local SEO.
