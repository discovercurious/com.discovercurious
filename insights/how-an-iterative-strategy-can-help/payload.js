If you don’t first identify low-performing options, you could get stuck with a strategy that’s a drain on resources instead of a boost to business performance.",spans:[]},{type:e,text:"Choosing how you identify low-performing strategies is just as important of a decision. Traditionally, clients hire a business consultant to test and research every possibility, this consultant then creates a robust strategy. This approach is expensive and time-consuming.

This cost is more than the average small to medium sized business can handle.",spans:[]},{type:e,text:"An iterative strategy flips this approach. Instead of creating a comprehensive plan from day one, an iterative strategy starts by identifying the low-hanging fruit. For example, your current marketing focus could be very narrow like Grammarly’s. Could widening it to encompass one or two more industries double your reach without changing your product? An iterative strategy focuses on wins like these and uses the momentum you achieve to build up to a bigger strategy.",spans:[]},{type:e,text:"Another difference between iterative and traditional approaches is the opportunity for testing and change. With the traditional approach, the business strategy will only go through minimal adjustments once it’s set.
