              <h4>About the facilitator</h4>
              <p>I’ve witnessed technology changing the ways we nurture business relationships. However, we still need to create meaningful connections to move our on and offline  business relationships forward.</p>
              <p>I believe that technology doesn't have to replace how we interact in person; it should enhance how we connect.</p>
              <p>I've spent over a decade collaborating with business owners, executives, and clients to make social platforms work for them. I focus on connecting the dots between social media, sales activities, advertising trends, revenue goals, and, most importantly, their time. The results are scalable marketing systems designed to help effectively nurture the business relationships that matter without sacrificing time or resources that could be spent on other high-impact activities. </p>
              <p>Rest assured that what you learn will work! It’s the process I use myself.</p>
