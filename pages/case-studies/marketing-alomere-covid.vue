              <h5>The Crisis</h5>
              <p>As COVID-19 reached Central Minnesota, all eyes were on the largest county employer and healthcare provider to lead them through a scary time. Alomere Health began using all of their resources to ramp up for an effective response to the immediate needs of potentially sick patients and a possible future surge. Yet, Alomere Health was not immune to the devastating economics that hit the state. All elective surgeries had been cancelled leaving the hospital and clinics with a dramatic drop in revenue. The responsibility to protect the community and survive economically was immense.</p>
              <h5>The Learning Process</h5>
               <p>In the early days of the crisis, the leadership at Alomere Health moved quickly. Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Deb Dittberner took the initiative early to begin the process of organizing the staff for an effective response. Together with CEO Carl Vaagenes, they initiated a community-wide plan to assemble enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep providers and patients safe. Alexandria Clinic mobilized a separate clinic for upper respiratory ailments that was a safe distance from the other clinics and hospital. In addition, a daily status call was initiated for all of the department directors and community leaders to keep everyone informed as efficiently as possible. Naturally, all of the public messaging from Alomere Health was very strict and succinct, "Wash your hands. Know the symptoms. Stay at home." The tone was grim and scary.</p>

          <h4>Stronger Together</h4>
          <div class="col1 s-textRow">
            <p>As Alomere Health’s communication partners, Curious was concerned about the tone of the public communications. We knew the community needed clear information on how to be safe, yet in a tone of voice that was calming and reassuring. Curious initiated an inspirational  “Community Strong” campaign on Alomere’s social media platforms to highlight all of the amazing efforts of their staff and community. This campaign changed the conversation from “Emergency!” to “We are stronger together.” And because of a tight-knit community, there were countless stories to share.</p>

            <h5>The good news was the “stay at home” messaging worked. The bad news was the “stay at home” messaging worked, which drastically reduced clinic visits.</h5>
            <p>Eddie Reif (Alomere’s Director of Community Relations &amp; Development), asked Curious to communicate the overall safety of visiting the clinics by highlighting the extensive safety protocols. In addition, and possibly more importantly, was to get the word out quickly about the easy-to-use telemedicine video visits, and the services that worked well for these types of visits.</p>

            <h4>Safe @ Work</h4>
              <p>As the state-wide quarantine orders loosened, Carl Vaagenes knew Alomere Health’s screening expertise would be helpful for all of the local businesses preparing for returning customers and employees. Curious launched the Safe@Work initiative that offers on-site or phone consultation for customizing workplace safety protocols outlined in the campaign. In addition, Alomere Health offers larger businesses on-site screening for employees coming into work.</p>
