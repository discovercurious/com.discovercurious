              <h5>A well-loved institution ponders its name</h5>
              <p>For sixty-plus years, the hospital in Alexandria, Minnesota, was known as Douglas County Hospital (DCH). Despite being beloved—we were told by several people that they would never call it anything else—the name had challenges:</p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>DCH served more than the Douglas area, with a reach that extended nine counties and beyond.</li>
                  <li>Its leading-care approach and excellent outcomes didn’t fit a &ldquo;county hospital&rdquo; image.</li>
                  <li>And it was no longer just a hospital, with 3 clinics and other specialty services.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <p>Because of these issues, the name hindered the ability to evolve easily with the rapid changes in healthcare, and it was challenging to communicate the amazing care the organization provided across multiple facilities and service lines. Carl Vaagenes, CEO, and the board knew that stellar community-owned healthcare could benefit from a presence that its current name constrained.</p>
              <p>The hard question was whether to change a name steeped with local history and generations-long relationships.</p>

              <h5>Checking the temperature for a change.</h5>
              <p>At the start of Curious’ engagement, we spent an hour each with 33 stakeholders of DCH. This wasn’t our original plan; the proposal included 12 interviews. But the further we got, the more we realized how important it was to hear prominent voices around an organization for which the community felt deep ownership. Three of the 33 interviewees said they would never support a name change, and another nine were on the fence, saying their support depended on what the new name was.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <p>So over a third of the county commissioners, local leaders and physicians were lukewarm-to-cold on the idea of name change. With a task to recommend &ldquo;go or no go&rdquo; on a new name, never had we embarked on a potential naming decision with such a headwind. At the same time, our interviews showed us what a remarkably effective, forward-looking, team-oriented and pragmatic culture DCH had built.</p>
              <p>We worked to confirm our interview discoveries with quantitative research. A response rate of 56% from the staff and 43% from the community was a clear signal that DCH had incredible engagement. Whether the name was left intact or changed, the decision was sure to be a hot topic.</p>

              <h5>Trusting the process.</h5>
              <p>Our final recommendation was to go forward with the rename. The research spoke to wanting a name that truly felt like who DCH was, a single name that would work across clinics and create a more cohesive culture, a name that would allow the organization to serve the area and be nimble to meet changing needs.</p>
              <p>With DCH being of-the-community and for-the-community, the name couldn’t just be picked by a select few, so Curious partnered with 3.2.1 for this project, using a data- driven tool called SparkTM. The Spark process allows diverse groups to speak their mind as it sorts and ranks the choices over 21 metrics.</p>
              <p>How diverse a group? For DCH, our first meeting to present 20 names (from a list of over 250) included 17 people. The process also reduced the power of power; with physicians, the CEO and board chair in the room, it was important to give everyone participating an equal footing. The Spark process does that.</p>
              <p>This is also where the process discovered a blindspot.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <h5>Seeing beyond the obvious.</h5>
              <p>As options were sorted, the leading names had a vague similarity. Alexandria is renowned for being nestled within a constellation of lakes. The names that rose to the top had &ldquo;lake&rdquo; in them in some form—making them indistinguishable from each other... and every other business in lakeland.</p>
              <p>This remarkable hospital system would not be well-served by an unremarkable name.</p>
              <p>With this aha, we went back to generate another 250 names.</p>
              <h5>Letting the cream rise.</h5>
              <p>The final three names jumped through Spark process hoops to make sure they fit with what we discovered from our research and the organization’s goals for the name. The three finalists then went on a tour of 10 community meetings, where we shared research findings as well as the hopes and dreams for the organization.</p>
              <p>The chosen name—Alomere Health—combines the idea of &ldquo;nurture&rdquo; and &ldquo;strengthen&rdquo;—alo in Latin—with the English word mere or lake. The &ldquo;healing waters&rdquo; of Alomere Health spoke to the lakes of the area, and also the core values of the organization.</p>

              <h5>The ending is the beginning.</h5>
              <p>The selection of Alomere Health set a critical piece in motion—an effective rollout that understands the difficulty of change. Months before the launch, Curious helped clinics and hospital leadership draft letters to the community, outlining a bold vision for healthcare locally, with a new name as one step on the journey. Come launch day, as signage around the campuses changed, we continued the conversation on social media.</p>
              <p>But a key element was inclusivity.</p>
              <p>Carl sent out an open call, inviting all interested staff to be ambassadors for the new name. This team created events and activities that helped the hospital share its story and vision, and inoculate itself against a natural human urge to resist even the best changes. The same team still meets, plans and celebrates, a testament to Alomere Health’s remarkable team-oriented culture.</p>
              <p>For Curious’ part, job one was to switch-out the countless places the logo appeared, but our success hinged on strengthening the voice and look of Alomere Health. We used discoveries from research to inform language and design so that all outward expressions of the brand could better reflect what was true within.</p>

              <p>Naming isn’t for the easily daunted. It’s a personal, often emotion-driven, worry- fraught choice in which &ldquo;I just don’t like it,&rdquo; is an easy way to dismiss the best group conversations.</p>
              <p>What was reinforced for us was the need to ground the process well—in the identity, culture, community, and goals and aspirations of the organization. These touchstones help raise the process above our personal tastes to help discover, collectively, what truly resonates.</p>
              <p>For Alomere Health, the name was quickly embraced, even by those resistant to change. After a year, the organization’s name was natural and right—in the community and beyond—allowing Alomere Health to add specialties, reach new clients and positively affect the health of the entire area for decades.</p>
